MeetFlow! This video calling website was built using JS, HTML, CSS, and the Jitsi video calling API.
With MeetFlow, users can easily connect with each other from anywhere in the world, without the need for any downloads or plugins. The website is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for anyone to create a video call in just a few clicks.
I'm excited to share MeetFlow with the world, and I hope that it will help bring people together and make remote communication a little bit easier. Thanks to everyone who supported me during the development process, and I can't wait to see where this project takes me next!"
